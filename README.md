Abstract: Antibiotic resistance is a public health threat associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and financial burden in nursing homes and other healthcare settings. Nursing home residents are at increased risk of colonization and infection due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers, and disseminators of antibiotic resistance within healthcare networks and across regions. Here, we sought to investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home in Chicago, IL, USA. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report not just the clonal spread of C. auris throughout the Chicago metropolitan region, but also pervasive strain sharing of virtually the full constellation of ESKAPE pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Integrating microbiome data with clinical microbiology findings, we detected carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on individuals identified as carriers of these genes months prior. To assess the generalizability of our findings, we analyzed publicly available shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples (stool, skin) collected from residents of seven other nursing homes with varying levels of medical acuity in two other states, elucidating additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing. Taken together, our data suggest the skin is a reservoir for colonization by C. auris and ESKAPE pathogens, and associated antibiotic resistance genes.
