Summary
Antimicrobial resistance is a public health threat associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and financial burden in nursing homes and other healthcare settings 1. Nursing home residents are at increased risk of colonization and infection due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers, and disseminators of antimicrobial resistance within healthcare networks and across regions2. Here, we sought to investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home in Chicago, IL, USA. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris throughout the Chicago metropolitan region. Additionally, we report sharing of a large constellation of ESKAPE (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii) within a nursing home. Integrating microbiome data with clinical microbiology results, we detected carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes months prior. To assess the generalizability of our findings, we analyzed publicly available shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples (stool, skin) collected from residents of seven other nursing homes with varying levels of medical acuity in three other states, elucidating additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing within nursing homes. Taken together, our data suggest the skin is a reservoir for colonization by C. auris and ESKAPE pathogens, and their associated antimicrobial resistance genes.
